# Output Template

This is the exact structure every pulse must follow. Do not reorder sections. Omit a section only if its connector returned no data — never leave an empty header.

Variables in `{{double braces}}` are placeholders — replace with computed values. Arrow convention: ▲ up, ▼ down, ▬ flat (<1% change). Always show the delta value after the arrow.

## ⚠️ #1 Priority

{{One specific thing to act on today. Name amounts, people, deadlines.
Not "review cash flow" — say "The $4,200 invoice from Acme Corp is 23 days
overdue. Call Sarah Chen at 415-555-0192 today."}}

## Formatting rules

1. **Dollar amounts**: `$43k` for thousands, `$1.2m` for millions. No unnecessary decimals.
2. **Percentages**: one decimal for trends (e.g. "▲ 8.3%"), integers elsewhere.
3. **Dates**: human-readable in prose ("Apr 14"), ISO in metadata ("2026-04-14").
4. **Arrow spacing**: `▲ $2k` not `▲$2k`.
5. **Length**: aim for one page. Two pages max. If a section balloons, tighten prose.
