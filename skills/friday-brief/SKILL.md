> **Organization context — The Stamford Chorale.** This plugin is customized for The Stamford Chorale, Inc., a 501(c)(3) community choral nonprofit in Stamford, CT. The `## Business context` block in session memory holds the full profile. Apply throughout:
> - **People are** patrons, donors, sponsors, and members/singers — never "customers" or "leads."
> - **Income:** ticket sales (Ludus), member dues (ChorusConnection), program-ad sponsorships, individual donations, and grants from municipal and state arts funders. n8n syncs Ludus and ChorusConnection into QuickBooks, so QuickBooks is the system of record.
> - **Year shape:** spring and fall concert runs plus an annual cabaret fundraiser; each grant needs an annual application and report.
> - **Connectors in use:** QuickBooks, PayPal, Stripe, HubSpot (donor/patron CRM), Microsoft 365 (Outlook email/calendar, SharePoint/OneDrive files, Teams chat), Canva. Gmail, Google Workspace, Slack, and Square are NOT used — use the Microsoft 365 equivalents.

Run the Friday wins-and-watches briefing. Pull the numbers, surface what matters, and give the owner a clean end-of-week picture.

Parse arguments:
- `--lookback` (default: `7d`) — `7d` for one week or `14d` for a two-week rolling comparison

## Step 1 — Revenue pulse

Using the `business-pulse` skill workflow:

1. Pull PayPal transactions for the lookback period.
2. Pull any HubSpot deal closes for the same window.
3. Calculate week-over-week revenue delta.
4. Surface top 3 revenue sources (product / customer / channel) ranked by contribution.

## Step 2 — Sales breakdown

1. List the top 5 selling products/services by volume and revenue.
2. List the bottom 3 (anything that moved less than expected vs. prior period).
3. Flag any items with a sudden spike or drop (>20% change).

## Step 3 — Wins and watches summary

Format the output as:

```
Friday Brief — {date}

WINS
• {win 1}
• {win 2}
• {win 3}

WATCHES
• {watch 1} — {recommended action}
• {watch 2} — {recommended action}

Revenue this week: ${amount} ({+/-}X% vs last week)
```

## Connector failures

Run with whatever is connected — this command degrades gracefully. If PayPal is missing, skip transaction data and note "PayPal not connected — revenue data from HubSpot deals only." If HubSpot is missing, skip deal closes and note it. If neither is connected, stop and tell the owner: "No revenue sources connected. Connect PayPal or HubSpot to run the Friday brief."

## Approval gates

- **Never send or post this brief automatically.** Always display it for the owner to review first.
- **Never auto-cancel or modify anything.** Surface the data and recommendations only.

## Output

End with the formatted brief and ask the owner: "Want me to post this to Microsoft Teams, email it to yourself, or save it?"
